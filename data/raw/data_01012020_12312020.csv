Notice to Tenants
Description
 I received a rent increase that I believe is unlawful because I was not given proper notice, was not properly served, and/or was not provided with the required RAP Notice (“Notice to Tenants of the Residential Rent Adjustment Program”).
Grounds
Fewer housing services
Description
The property owner is providing me with fewer housing services than I previously received and/or I am being charged for services originally paid for by the owner. (Check this box for petitions based on bad conditions/failure to repair.)
Grounds
Rent Initiation
Description
The initial rent amount when I first moved in was unlawful because the property owner was not permitted to set the initial rent without limitation. O.M.C. § 8.22.080 (C). ",,2022-03-23

Incorrect Rent Increase
Description
a) The CPI and/or banked rent increase notice I was given was calculated incorrectly.
Grounds
Rent Increase Exceeds CPI or more than 10%
Description
b) The increase (or increases) exceeds the CPI Adjustment and is unjustified, or is greater than 10%.
Grounds
No Pre Approval of Increase
Description
c) I received a rent increase notice before the property owner received approval from the Rent Adjustment Program for such an increase and the rent increase exceeds the CPI Adjustment and the available banked
rent increase.
Grounds
Second Increase in 12 months
Description
g) The increase I am contesting is the second increase in my rent in a 12-month period.
Grounds
Decrease in Services
Description
i) My property owner is providing me with fewer housing services than I previously received or is charging me for services originally paid by the owner. (OMC 8.22.070(F): A decrease in housing services is considered an increase in rent. A tenant may petition for a rent adjustment based on a decrease in housing services.)
Grounds
Exceeds 30% in 5 years 
Description
k) The proposed rent increase would exceed an overall increase of 30% in 5 years. (The 5-year period begins with notice(s) of rent increases on or after August 1, 2014).",,2022-03-23

Grounds
No Pre Approval of Increase

rent increase.
Grounds
No Concurrent RAP Notice
Description
d) No written notice of Rent Program was given to me together with the notice of increase(s) I am contesting. (Only for increases noticed after July 26, 2000.)
Grounds
No RAP Notice at Inception or 6 Months Prior
Description
e) The property owner did not give me the required form “Notice of the Rent Adjustment Program” at least 6 months before the effective date of the rent increase(s).
Grounds
Rent Increase Violates State Law

f) The rent increase notice(s) was (were) not given to me in compliance with State law.

Grounds
Exceeds 30% in 5 years
