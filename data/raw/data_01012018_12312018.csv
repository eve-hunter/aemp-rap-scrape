Incorrect Rent Increase
Description
a) The CPI and/or banked rent increase notice I was given was calculated incorrectly.
Grounds
Rent Increase Exceeds CPI or more than 10%
Description
b) The increase (or increases) exceeds the CPI Adjustment and is unjustified, or is greater than 10%.
Grounds
No Pre Approval of Increase
Description

rent increase.
Grounds
Second Increase in 12 months
Description
g) The increase I am contesting is the second increase in my rent in a 12-month period.
Grounds
Decrease in Services
Description
i) My property owner is providing me with fewer housing services than I previously received or is charging me for services originally paid by the owner. (OMC 8.22.070(F): A decrease in housing services is considered an increase in rent. A tenant may petition for a rent adjustment based on a decrease in housing services.)
Grounds
No Rent Reduction after CI Increase
Description
j) My rent was not reduced after a prior rent increase period for a Capital Improvement had expired.
Grounds
No Summary Provided
Description
m)  The owner did not give me justification(s) for the rent increase(s) despite my written request.",,2022-03-24
