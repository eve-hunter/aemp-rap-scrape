Allowable Amount I received a rent increase above the allowable amount.
Notice to Tenants  I received a rent increase that I believe is unlawful because I was not given proper notice, was not properly served, and/or was not provided with the required RAP Notice (“Notice to Tenants of the Residential Rent Adjustment Program”).
Rent Initiation The initial rent amount when I first moved in was unlawful because the property owner was not permitted to set the initial rent without limitation. O.M.C. § 8.22.080 (C). ",,2022-03-22

Notice to Tenants  I received a rent increase that I believe is unlawful because I was not given proper notice, was not properly served, and/or was not provided with the required RAP Notice (“Notice to Tenants of the Residential Rent Adjustment Program”).
Code Violation I received a rent increase and do not believe I should have to pay it because a government agency has cited my unit for serious health, safety, fire, or building code violations. (You must attach copy of citation to petition.)
Fewer housing services The property owner is providing me with fewer housing services than I previously received and/or I am being charged for services originally paid for by the owner. (Check this box for petitions based on bad conditions/failure to repair.)
